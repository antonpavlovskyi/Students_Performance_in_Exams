## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There are no specific requirements to run and explore this project. Python 3.8.5 and current versions (as of 20/04/2021) of the following libraries were used:

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Using dataset from Kaggle I wanted to answer the following questions using different types of visualization:

1. Which factors influence students' exam scores?
2. How strong such influence is?
3. Which factors affect scores more when taking into account gender, race/ethnicity, lunch type etc.
4. Is there any correlation between different exam scores themselves?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available above which answers the above mentioned questions. There is also a downloaded copy of the dataset from Kaggle (version as of 20/04/2021)

## Results<a name="results"></a>

Every plot and graph in the notebook is followed by a markdown cell that outlines its key findings.
